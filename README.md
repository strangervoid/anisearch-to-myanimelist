# anisearch-to-myanimelist

A little script that converts your exported .json file from anisearch.de and creates a suitable .xml file for import on myanimelist.com ðŸŽŒ
Source code's in german here and there but that's probably no biggy since it's for anisearch users who are mainly german anyways.

If you have issues please contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/voidedmile) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/104627481767604224) 




## What you need

- Python installed on your machine to execute the script: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- The [requests HTTP library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- A client ID to access the [MAL-API](https://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=13727) which you can [configure here](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig)


## How to Use

- Export your anisearch anime list: https://www.anisearch.de/usercp/list/anime/export
- Edit the script with your MAL developer client ID and the name of your .json file
- Make sure both the script and the .json file are in the same folder and then execute the script
- Wait for a while for it to finish (depends on the size of your list, really)
- Head over to the MAL [import page](https://myanimelist.net/import.php), choose MyAnimeList Import as the type and enjoy


## Change log:

- added timetracking
- added logfile in case of sus IDs
- added asynchronous handling of the API calls (cuts down the execution time by a lot. apparently, hitting the MAL API rate-limit's hard lol)
